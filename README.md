# Blackjack-Java
The Blackjack game is a simple one-on-one applet that competes versus the computer. The user is given the option to 
alter the bet amount, hit, or stay. If the user runs out of available funds, then the game will
automatically restart. Images were used to display the gaming table and cards used.
